* _Sentiment-semantic Word Vectors: A New Method to Estimate Management Sentiment_, 2024, forthcoming in Swiss Journal of Economics and Statistics [[Paper](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4723125)]
  
  **Abstract:** This paper introduces a novel method to extract the sentiment embedded in the Management's Discussion and Analysis (MD&A) section of 10-K filings. The proposed method outperforms traditional approaches in terms of sentiment classification accuracy. Utilizing this method, the MD&A sentiment is found to be a strong negative predictor of future stock returns, demonstrating consistency in both in-sample and out-of-sample settings. By contrast, if traditional sentiment extraction methods are used, the MD&A sentiment exhibits no predictive ability for stock markets. Additionally, the MD&A sentiment is associated with dividend-related macroeconomic channels regarding future stock return prediction.

# Working papers
* _Unveiling Themes in 10-K Disclosures: A New Topic Modeling Perspective_, 2024, jointly with Matthias Fengler [[Paper](https://econpapers.repec.org/paper/usgeconwp/2023_3a07.htm)]

  **Abstract:** We investigate the topics in the Management's Discussion and Analysis (MD&A) section of 10-K filings. Our approach extracts MD&A topics by clustering words around anchor words that broadly define potential themes. The resulting topics are intelligible, distinct, and multi-faceted, shedding light on why classical topic models applied to 10-K filings might lack interpretability. We extract two loading series from the MD&As: topic prevalence and topic sentiment. We find that topic prevalence exhibits significant variation throughout the sample period, while sentiment displays marked heterogeneity across topics. Linking MD&A topics to stock returns, we document non-uniform market perceptions toward the topic sentiment.
  
* _LongFinBERT: A Language Model for Very Long Financial Documents_, 2024, jointly with Erik-Jan Senn [Paper]

  **Abstract:** This paper introduces LongFinBERT, a modern language model specialized for excessively long financial documents. LongFinBERT shows remarkable efficiency, requiring significantly less computational costs than other state-of-the-art language models. This unique characteristic enables LongFinBERT to process an entire financial document in a single pass, which is typically infeasible with other language models. Leveraging this advantage, we apply LongFinBERT to detect financial misreporting using 10-K filings from January 1999 to December 2018. Misreporting detection utilizing text-based features from LongFinBERT outperforms that of canonical accounting variables or other text models. Finally, investors are responsive to year-over-year alterations of accounting disclosures, measured by LongFinBERT.

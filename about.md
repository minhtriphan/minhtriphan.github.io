I am currently a Data Analyst intern at the German Federal Bank in Frankfurt am Main, Germany. Simultaneously, I am pursuing a PhD in Economics and Finance at the University of St.Gallen, where I also work as a Research Assistant in the Faculty of Mathematics and Statistics. My research focuses on textual analysis and natural language processing, with applications in economics and finance, particularly in asset pricing.

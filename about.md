I'm a Data Analyst intern at the German Federal Bank in Frankfurt am Main, Germany. I also am doing a PhD in Economics and Finance at the University of St.Gallen, where I am also working as a Research Assistant at the Faculty of Mathematics and Statistics. My research areas focus on textual analysis, natural language processing, and their applications in economics and finance, especially asset pricing.
